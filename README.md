# Data Structure and Algorithm in Kotlin

This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in Kotlin.

## Contents

1. Stack - A simple implementation of a stack data structure. The stack operations such as push, pop, and checking if the stack is empty are implemented.
2. Queue - A simple implementation of a queue data structure. The queue operations such as enqueue (insertion) and dequeue (removal) are implemented.
3. LinkedList - A simple implementation of a linked list data structure. The linked list operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal are implemented.
4. DoublyLinkedList - A simple implementation of a doubly linked list data structure. The doubly linked list operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal are implemented.
5. Tree - A simple implementation of a tree data structure. The tree operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal are implemented.
6. BinarySearchTree - A simple implementation of a binary search tree data structure. The binary search tree operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal are implemented.Binary search tree is a binary tree in which the left child is less than the parent and the right child is greater than the parent.
7. Graph - A simple implementation of a graph data structure. The graph operations such as adding a vertex, adding an edge, and traversing the graph are implemented.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

- IntelliJ IDEA 2023.3.3
- Kotlin
- Java

### Installing

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA
3. Run the main function in each file to test the data structure

## Running the tests

Each file can be run individually to test the data structure implemented in it.
